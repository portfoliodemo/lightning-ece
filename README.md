# **Lightning-ECE**

*On-Demand Early Childhood Educator Staffing Platform*

## 🧠 Overview

**Lightning-ECE** is a full-stack web application (currently frontend-only) that connects daycare owners with certified Early Childhood Educators (ECEs) who are available on short notice. This platform addresses real-world staffing challenges through a responsive, role-based system:

* 👩‍🏫 **Daycare Owners** can browse and book qualified, verified ECEs.
* 📆 **ECEs** can manage their availability and accept or decline job offers.
* 🔐 **Admins** oversee verification, support, and platform integrity (planned for future implementation).
